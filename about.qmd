I’m Rithvik Madhavaram, currently pursuing a Master’s in Data Analytics Engineering at George Mason University. I hold a Bachelor’s in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology. My skills include Python, C, Java, and Verilog, with experience in data structures and algorithms.

I have worked on projects such as a face detection system using OpenCV and a Turbo coder for error correction in digital communication. My internships at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and IBM have provided me with valuable insights into hydraulic systems and artificial intelligence.

Beyond academics, I enjoy dancing, listening to music, playing cricket, and watching Formula 1. I am passionate about leveraging my skills to contribute to innovative solutions in data analytics.
